# a better INPUT
This BASIC V2 code can be used in place of the INPUT command.  It ignores CRSR and HOME keystrokes.  

The standard INPUT command allows the user to move the cursor around the screen with the CRSR up/down, left/right, and HOME keys and even clear the screen. This code ignores CRSR, HOME and Function keystrokes on the Commodore 64. All other keystrokes are used to build a string with a length specified by the user. Text color is also specified by the user. It could be incorporated as a subroutine into any BASIC program on the C64. Information on the POKES and PEEKS can be found in the book, Peeks and Pokes for the Commodore 64 - https://archive.org/details/peeks-and-pokes-for-the-commodore-64, and Mapping the Commodore 64 - https://archive.org/details/Compute_s_Mapping_the_Commodore_64

The code is supplied in a d64 image and text file
